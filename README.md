# Project Bird Brain

This is a sample project using a [DeepLens](https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/), the [Caltech CUB-200-2011 dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) and the [ResNet 18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) neural network architecture, with automatic image uploads to S3. I used this with [Hugo Easy Gallery](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery) but the approach will work with other image gallery solutions. Check out the [Bird Brain Gallery](https://cameronworrell.me/birdbrain) and [the blog post](https://cameronworrell.me/blog/blog009/).
