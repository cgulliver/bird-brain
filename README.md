# Project Bird Brain

This is a sample project using a [DeepLens](https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/), the [Caltech CUB-200-2011 dataset](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html) and the [ResNet 18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) neural network architecture, with automatic image uploads to S3 based on configured probability threshold. It is based on the [sample Bird Classification project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deeplens/latest/dg/deeplens-templated-projects-overview.html#bird-classification) provided by AWS. I used this with [Hugo Easy Gallery](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery) but the approach will work with other image gallery solutions.
